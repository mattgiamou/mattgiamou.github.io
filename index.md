    Hello! I'm a roboticist working on state estimation and planning under Prof. Jonathan Kelly at the  <a href="https://starslab.ca">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (STARS)</a> at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>. I received my SM in aerospace engineering with the <a href="http://acl.mit.edu/">Aerospace Controls Lab</a> at MIT in 2017, and my BASc in engineering science from UofT in 2015.

My research focuses on convex optimization for fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to geometric problems in robotics. This approach has yielded results in [multi-sensor calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08298), [supervised deep learning for rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01031), and [inverse kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09318). I believe that developing a mathematically rich and clearly articulated _science_ of robotics is just as important as design and engineering, and hope to contribute to the safe and socially responsible deployment of robots and other autonomous systems.
