  title: Matt Giamou, roboticist
---

Hello and hey! I'm a roboticist working on state estimation and planning under Prof. Jonathan Kelly at the [Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (STARS)](https://starslab.ca) at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca). 

My research is mostly focused on using convex optimization techniques to design fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to problems in robotics. This approach has yielded results in [multi-sensor calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08298), [supervised deep learning for rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01031), and [inverse kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09318). I believe that a mathematically rich and clearly articulated _science_ of robotics is just as important as engineering, and hope to contribute to the safe and socially responsible deployment of robots and other autonomous systems.
