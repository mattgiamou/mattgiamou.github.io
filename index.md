    Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://neural.lab.northeastern.edu"> Northeastern University Robust Autonomy Laboratory (NEURAL)</a>, where I am developing global polynomial optimization techniques for robust machine perception. I recently received my PhD with Prof. Jonathan Kelly's <a href="https://starslab.ca">Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (STARS)</a> at the <a href="https://utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>. I received my SM in aerospace engineering with the <a href="http://acl.mit.edu/">Aerospace Controls Lab</a> at MIT in 2017, and my BASc in engineering science from UofT in 2015.

**I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at McMaster University's Department of Computing and Software in July of 2023!**

I am recruiting graduate students to start as early as the Fall of 2023. Please contact me if you are interested in and have experience in any of the following areas:

* theory and implementation of nonlinear and nonconvex optimization algorithms;
* perception and state estimation for mobile robots;
* probability, statistics, and machine learning;
* motion planning and control for robot manipulators; and
* experiments involving software and hardware integration for autonomous ground vehicles and manipulator robots.

I am eager to form a diverse team that will tackle core theoretical problems at the heart of safe and effective autonomy while simultaneously building a world-class laboratory for experiments on real robots.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on convex optimization for fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to geometric problems in robotics. This approach has yielded results in [multi-sensor calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08298), [supervised deep learning for rotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01031), and [inverse kinematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09318). I believe that developing a mathematically rich and clearly articulated _science_ of robotics is just as important as design and engineering, and hope to contribute to the safe and socially responsible deployment of robots and other autonomous systems.
