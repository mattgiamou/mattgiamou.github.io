  title: Matt Giamou, roboticist

Hello and hey! I'm a roboticist working on state estimation and planning under Prof. Jonathan Kelly at the [Space and Terrestrial Autonomous Robotic Systems (STARS)](https://starslab.ca) at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca). 

My research is mostly focused on using convex optimization techniques to design fast and hopefully provably optimal or robust solutions to problems in robotics. This approach has yielded results in multi-sensor calibration, supervised deep learning for rotations, and inverse kinematics. I believe that the _science_ of robotics is just as important as the engineering, and hope to contribute to the safe and socially responsible deployment of robots and other autonomous systems.
