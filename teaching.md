A summary of my work as a TA and instructor at the University of Toronto.

---


## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (ROB311)

I helped design and eventually taught a semester-long course based on the classic [AIMA textbook](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). 
Lectures, assignments and exams covered: the history of AI, search, logic, constraint programming, game playing AI, ethics of AI, planning, decision tree learning, (partially observable) Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning. 

Assignments included Python implementation of various important algorithms and an essay on ethical issues surrounding advances in AI systems. 

### **2021** 路 Instructor 路 University of Toronto
Remotely delivered lectures to a class of 77 students during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of two TAs, the course's assessments were modified to a format appropriate for remote learning.

### **2019-2020** 路 Teaching Assistant 路 University of Toronto 
Duties included creating Matlab and Python assignments with [Autolab](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab), running tutorials, answering students' questions, and creating and grading midterm questions.
