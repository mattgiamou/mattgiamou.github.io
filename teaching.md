A summary of my work as a TA and instructor at the University of Toronto.

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (ROB311)

I helped design and eventually taught a semester-long [3rd year engineering science course](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/rob311h1) based on Russel and Norvig's [classic textbook](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) and Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). 
Lectures, assignments and exams covered: the history of AI, search, logic, constraint programming, game playing AI, ethics of AI, planning, decision tree learning, (partially observable) Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning. 

Python programming assignments included: 

- Basic search algorithms over graphs and trees
- Robot motion planning
- A game-playing AI competition
- Solving MDPs and $k$-armed bandit problems
- An essay on ethical issues surrounding advances in AI systems
