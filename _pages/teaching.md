### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (ROB311)

**2019-2021** · TA & Instructor · University of Toronto, Division of Engineering Science

I helped design and implement a course based on the classic [AIAMA textbook](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). 
Lectures, assignments and exams covered: the history of AI, search, logic, constraint programming, game playing AI, planning, (partially observable) Markov decision processes, and reinforcement learning.
