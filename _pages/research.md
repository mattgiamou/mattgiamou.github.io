### Certifiable Sensor Calibration

### Distance-Geometric Inverse Kinematics
My colleague [Filip MariÄ‡]() and I have been working on a series of papers that look at inverse kinematics (IK) from a fresh distance-geometric perspective. 

### Principled Representations of SO(3) for Learning

### Resource-Efficient Multi-Robot SLAM
